# Mining Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

First of all, Almost 98% of iron ore is used in steel making. The iron ore has an impurity called silica. The Impurity such as silica adversely affects the production of iron and steel. Freeport â€“ McMoRan is one of the largest mining companies in the US. They use these AI models to boost the output in their mining facilities. In this project, we will train the machine learning and deep learning models to predict the    % of Silica Concentrate in the Iron Ore concentrate
